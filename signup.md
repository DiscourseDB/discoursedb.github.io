<h2>Getting access to DiscourseDB</h2>

<b>Test out the software?</b> If you would like to try discoursedb just to see what the infrastructure is
capable of, please email 
<a href="mailto:discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu">discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</a>,
letting us know who you are, and we'll give you access to a sample dataset.  You do need to 
have a Google ID to use the browser -- this is usually a gmail address, but you can register
any email with Google (via https://myaccount.google.com)

<b>Access research data?</b> We will also be making research datasets available through the DiscourseDB
browser, but this requires some conversation and paperwork, since the data is IRB protected.  Contact
us at <a href="mailto:discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu">discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</a>.

<b>Set up your own server?</b> DiscourseDB is open source software, so if you'd like to set up your
own server, feel free to download it, and you can ask for help at 
<a href="mailto:discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu">discoursedb-help@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</a>
or by opening an issue on the appropriate github project.
